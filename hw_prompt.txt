Using what we learned in class, create a mockup of a Pokedex.. 
when you enter a Pokemon name, it should make an API call and get 
all the data.. then display some of that information to your html page
(couple of pokemon names to try: "ditto", "pikachu", "charizard")


Features should include:
-name
-image(hint: the path to the image is 'sprites' -> 'front_default')


Extra credit: List out all the pokemon's abilities and get a different 
(better?) image
